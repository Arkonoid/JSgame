# JSgame
A browser-based JavaScript game that incorporates a weather API that changes the weather during battles.

Made for a project as a part of a class.

### The Project Requirements
### -------------------------

#### First Group
#### -----------
1: Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.

2: Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  Basic math functions donâ€™t count (e.g. addition, etc).

3: Visualize data in a user friendly way. (I would say the Battle Stats meet this requirement)

4: Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
