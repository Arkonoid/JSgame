# projects-blog

Originally, this was meant to be a blog site with different pages showcasing various things I like to do
or am passionate about. However, that quickly spiraled out of scope. The end product sort of shows of a few things
I wanted to in the beginning, but not much. It does still meet course requirements though.

The requirements met are:

-CSS animation on the Javascript Game Command Buttons

-Grid layout changes for screens greater than 700px wide (Technically on the Home page and Game but more tangibly
on the Art and Music pages, where the pictures/tracks align vertically for mobile, and tile on desktop. I didn't feel
the content on the main pages was substantal enough to radically change, and same goes for the game. Although
I did make the buttons easier to click for desktop users.)

P.S. Also adds a new button and changes animations for the game on mobile devices and tablets,
but that was technically done using jQuery and JavaScript, not CSS media queries

-JavaScript function that shows or hides content on the site through interacting with the game.

-JavaScript function that performs mathmatical operations all througout the game

-Not sure if it counts, but the objects for enemies and player classes store info like an array, and is displayed
and dynamically updated throughout the game.
