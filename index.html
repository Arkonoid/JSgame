            My name is Tyler McIntyre, I am a hobbiest programer who also dabbles a bit in art and music.
            This site is a project for a coding class and showcases some examples of things I've done or am working on.
            You can see art and music I've done, or look at some coding projects I've worked on.
            Although the original purpose for the site was just to pass a final exam, I hope to keep updating it and improving it
            so I can keep an archive of my stuff and look back on how much I've improved years down the line.
